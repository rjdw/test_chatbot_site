          In Book V of Paradise Lost, Milton uses Eve&rsquo;s recollection of
          her dream to characterize Satan&rsquo;s unrequited yearning for
          Heaven in the typical style of Petrarchan love poetry. The dream,
          although told to us through the voice of Eve, is in fact a
          metaphysical conjuring by Satan, who is attempting to entice Eve
          into eating from the Tree of Knowledge. As such, we as readers can
          consider the occurrences within the dream as Satan&rsquo;s personal
          idea of Heaven, and as such, an insight towards Satan&rsquo;s
          longing for Heaven.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dream begins with Satan&rsquo;s beckoning of Eve from a gentle
          whisper in her ear. This whisper is not a simple calling of
          Eve&rsquo;s name; rather, Satan describes the beauty of Heaven, with
          the cool night and the sing-song birds. Satan&rsquo;s description
          ends with the fully iambic phrase, &ldquo;now reigns / Full-orbed
          the moon, and, with more pleasing light&rdquo; (5:41-42). The iambic
          meter suggests the fantastical nature of beauty in Satan&rsquo;s
          manifestation of Heaven.
        </p>

        <p>
          Satan&rsquo;s description of his Heaven compares to the depiction of
          Petrarch&rsquo;s Laura which often likens the woman to some
          supraphysiological beauty (i.e. Sonnet XII &ldquo;Enthrones in
          perfect beauty like a star, \ As far as she outshines the
          rest&rdquo; (1)). However, Satan comes to the forlorn conclusion
          that Heaven&rsquo;s beauty is in fact not for him and tells Eve,
          &ldquo;Shadowy sets off the face of things &ndash; in vain, / If
          none regards.&rdquo; (5:43-44). Milton begins the phrase with
          stressed anti-iambic, leading right off the perfect iambic meter
          from line 42. Furthermore, Milton delays the crux of the phrase
          &ldquo;&ndash; in vain [!]&rdquo;, to augment the emotion in
          Satan&rsquo;s speech. With this meter and phrasing, Milton is
          indicating Satan&rsquo;s genuine sorrow in the fact that there is no
          one to take in Heaven&rsquo;s beauty. Again, the alternation between
          the bliss and sorrow of love is akin to the tone common in
          Petrarchan love poetry. The alternation between extreme emotion of
          Petrarchan love is especially apparent in Petrarch and Shakespeare
          poems on unrequited love, as is the case with Satan and his Heaven.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us fast-forward in the dream to Eve seeing Satan as the Heavenly
          angel captivated by the Tree of Knowledge. Satan admires the beauty
          of the Tree of Knowledge and laments that the taste of its fruit is
          forbidden (5:58-61). However, Satan then proceeds to break the
          convention of Petrarchan love by plucking a fruit and tasting it
          (5:65). Petrarch himself never actualized his love with Laura, and
          Petrarchan love poems are primarily an account of his thoughts while
          in love and after her death, but never of their interaction.
          Similarly, Shakespeare never becomes acquainted with the Dark Lady,
          who instead associates herself with the Fair Youth. The idea of
          achieving love is not conducive with the Petrarch scheme of
          attraction. And to the realization that Satan had attained the
          source of his longing, Eve is bewildered telling Adam, &ldquo;Me
          damp horror chilled \ At such bold words vouched with a deed so
          bold&rdquo; (5:65-66). Milton allows for repeat dactyl meters with
          an added stress on &ldquo;Me damp horror chilled&rdquo; (- / / /)
          (5:65), and &ldquo;At such bold words&rdquo; (- / / /) (5:66). The
          repetition reinforces the oddity of breaking the Petrarchan scheme
          of unrequited love, where Satan actually realizes his longing for
          Heaven.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once he eats the fruit, Satan returns to Eve and talks to her with a
          perfect, soothing iambic meter, &ldquo;Sweet of thyself &#8230;
          happy though thou art&rdquo; (5:68-75). Satan breaks the iambic
          meter with an anti-iambic only to tell Eve, with emphasis,
          &ldquo;Happier thou may&rsquo;st be, worthier canst not be&rdquo;
          (5:76). Fooled by Satan&rsquo;s poetic speech, in the dream, Eve
          also consumes the fruit of knowledge and soars into the sky with
          Satan, only to fall once Satan disappears (5:85-91). As readers, we
          can read this fall as the metaphoric Fall of Man.
        </p>

        <p>
          With an understanding of the archetypal Petrarch love, Satan&rsquo;s
          conjured dream and Eve&rsquo;s retelling can be seen as
          Satan&rsquo;s nostalgic longing for Heaven. Milton uses the model of
          Petrarchan love in Satan&rsquo;s depiction of Heaven only to
          emphatically break it. Eve recants her horror, conveying to the
          audience the magnitude of the moment. We are to understand that the
          disruption of the idealistic Petrarchan love is the beginning of
          Satan&rsquo;s connivery. Milton thus uses the archetype of
          Petrarchan love to push the narrative of Satan&rsquo;s cunning and
          his deception towards Eve.
